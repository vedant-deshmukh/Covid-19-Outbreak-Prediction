# Covid-19-Outbreak-Prediction
<h3><b>Coronavirus Outbreak Prediction using Machine Learning</b></h3>
<h4> This project aims at predicting the daily number of Corona Virus cases. This project is built using Linear Regression model in Supervised Machine Learning.
<br><br>
This Project includes-
<br> <br>
<ul>
<li> Data Cleaning, Data Visualization and Data Analysis of a Covid19_cases Dataset from Kaggle.com using certain Python Libraries.
<li> A Linear Regression Model is created that is capable of predicting the number of covid cases.
<li> The model is able to give a quite accurate prediction of new Covid19 cases.
 <li> The created model is also evaluated and checked for accuracy.
</ul>
